# USN-Porsgrunn-Solardata

A static database containing historical data for the solar power installation at USN Porsgrunn.\
It contains Solar PV output 5min resolution from 14.08.24-12.07.25\
We are presently working on making this a dynamic database, so come back for more.
It will also contain weather parameters with the same resolution.

This autumn we are installing a small vind turbine, fuel cell and electrolyser\
The data from this will be available in the autumn of 2025.\
So stay tuned for more data.......
